Hero image

- `hero.jpg` has been added to `assets/` and is now used as the hero background.
- For better compression and browser support, add a `hero.webp` file with the same dimensions; the CSS attempts to use `/assets/hero.webp` first and falls back to `/assets/hero.jpg`.
- Recommended sizes: 1600x900 (desktop), 1200x675 (tablet), 800x450 (mobile). Create responsive variants and replace the background with optimized files when ready.
- Use tools like Squoosh or imagemin to compress images while preserving visual quality.
